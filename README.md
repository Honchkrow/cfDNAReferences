# cfDNAReferences

cfDNAReferences is a tiny database for cell free DNA analysis. We collected frequently used genome markers/features for our python wrapped pipeline [cfDNApipe](https://honchkrow.github.io/cfDNApipe/), which contains many integrated algorithms for cell free DNA analysis.

Note: hg38 is not valid now.
